This is a simple Sudoku solver, written as a learning exercise. I'm attempting
to be as idiomatic as possible but parts of this still remain awkward. There's
probably a clever way to factor out the branch-and-bound algorithm into
something generic and encode Sudoku's constraints concisely but I haven't
thought too deeply about it yet.
